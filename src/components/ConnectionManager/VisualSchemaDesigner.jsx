 * Visual Schema Designer Component
 * 
 * This file serves as an entry point to the refactored Visual Schema Designer.
 * The implementation has been broken down into smaller, more manageable components:
 * 
 * - TableNode: Component for rendering database tables
 * - CustomEdge: Component for rendering relationships between tables
 * - Utility functions: Functions for schema operations and compatibility checks
 * - Styled components: UI styling separated into dedicated files
 * 
 * @see ./VisualSchemaDesigner/index.jsx for the main implementation
